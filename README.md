# Real-time Anomaly Detection in Traffic and Pollution Data Streams with Spark Structured Streaming

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a real-time anomaly detection system for traffic and pollution data in the city of Madrid, using Apache Spark Structured Streaming and machine learning models. The system will process real-time data streams, identify unusual patterns, and generate alerts to improve traffic management and air quality.

## Objectives

*   Implement a real-time data processing pipeline with Spark Structured Streaming.
*   Integrate traffic and pollution data sources from Madrid.
*   Develop and train machine learning models for anomaly detection.
*   Generate real-time alerts for unusual behavior.
*   Visualize the results in an interactive dashboard with Streamlit.

## Tools and Technologies

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Data Processing:** Apache Spark Structured Streaming (PySpark)
*   **Machine Learning:** MLlib, Scikit-learn
*   **Visualization:** Streamlit
*   **Dependency Management:** Poetry
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
*   **Experiment Tracking:** MLflow
